                This creature loves to follow humans. He needs fresh air every day. He behaves differently in different weather. On sunny day, he is in a good mood, so his footprints will be colored. At the same time, he will continue to grow and prepare to breed, after which he will return to his initial size and disappear shortly after. Newly born creatures do not follow humans autonomously, and need to be reminded to acquire this habit. In particular, this creature can only reproduce once a day. In rainy days, his mood will become very bad, unwilling to take the initiative to follow humans, and he needs constant reminders from humans. In addition, we also found that he was very light weight, because on windy days, his feet would become wobbly.
